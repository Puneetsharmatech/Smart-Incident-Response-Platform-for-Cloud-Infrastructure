    # Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server, which is
    # required to run FastAPI applications. `[standard]` includes common dependencies
    # like `websockets` and `httptools`.

    # Azure Identity library provides Azure Active Directory authentication support.
    # It allows our application to authenticate to Azure services using Managed Identity
    # without needing to manage credentials manually.
    azure-identity

    # Azure Monitor Query library is part of the Azure SDK for Python.
    # It provides client objects for querying metrics and logs from Azure Monitor.
    azure-monitor-query

    # Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library using Python type hints.
    # FastAPI uses Pydantic extensively for defining request bodies, response models,
    # and configuration settings, ensuring data integrity and providing automatic documentation.
    pydantic

    # Python-dotenv is used for loading environment variables from a .env file.
    # This is primarily useful for local development, allowing you to manage environment
    # variables outside of your code. On the Azure VM, when Managed Identity is used,
    # this file won't be strictly necessary for Azure authentication, but it's good
    # practice for other configuration.
    python-dotenv
